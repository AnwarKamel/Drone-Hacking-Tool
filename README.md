## Overview
  
Drones, as a high mobility item that can be carried around easily and launched, are becoming cheaper and more popular among the public, they can be seen almost anywhere nowadays.
 
However, the drone built-in flying cameras could use for illegal usage like candid photos on private property. This shows drones clearly present risks to public safety and personal privacy.

Therefore, we are working on using wireless connection methods (Wi-Fi, GPS) to hack it and take over. In this project, our goal is to capture drones to stop users with malicious intent for proof of concept and a sense of accomplishment.
  
## Before to start

### Software

#### Operating System selection

Due to Robot Operating System (ROS) Kinetic primarily targeting Ubuntu 16.04, so we advise using Ubuntu 16.04 for running this tool.
  
#### Install ROS

Before you start using this tool, you must install Robot Operating System (ROS) Kinetic on your Ubuntu. For more information, please [click here](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic).

#### Install ROS driver
  
Please install the driver for ROS to communicate with the drone. The driver called [tello_driver](https://github.com/appie-17/tello_driver) and [bebop_autonomy](https://github.com/AutonomyLab/bebop_autonomy). In this tool, we tested DJI Tello and Parrot Bebop 2 works with this tool, users can use this tool for takeoff, landing and viewing the live camera content.
  
You may also install another ROS driver for hacking other drones, but you need to edit the source code and we cannot promise it can work with this tool.

#### Install Aircrackâ€“ng suite

### Hardware

#### HackRF One

HackRF One from Great Scott Gadgets is a Software Defined Radio peripheral capable of transmission or reception of radio signals from 1 MHz to 6 GHz. For more information, please visit the [official website](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/).

In this tool, we are using HackRF One to perform a fake GPS attack to force the drone to land or fly away from the fake GPS signal covered area.

#### USB Wifi adapter
